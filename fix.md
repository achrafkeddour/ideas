To resolve the "SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation" error without disabling Secure Boot, you can update the shim and GRUB packages on your Debian 12 system. Here are the steps and commands to try:

1. Boot into a Live Linux Environment:

If you can't boot into Debian because of the error, you may need to use a live USB to boot into a temporary Linux environment.



2. Chroot into Your Existing Debian Installation:

If using a live environment, mount your Debian partition and chroot into it. Replace /dev/sdXn with the correct partition identifier for your root filesystem:

sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo chroot /mnt



3. Update the Shim and GRUB Packages:

Run the following commands to update shim, grub-efi-amd64, and grub-efi-amd64-signed to ensure you have the latest versions:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall shim-signed grub-efi-amd64 grub-efi-amd64-signed



4. Reinstall GRUB to the EFI Partition:

Reinstall GRUB to ensure that the boot loader is properly configured:

sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=debian --recheck
sudo update-grub



5. Exit the Chroot Environment and Reboot:

If you used a live environment and chroot, exit the chroot and unmount the partitions:

exit
sudo umount /mnt/dev
sudo umount /mnt/proc
sudo umount /mnt/sys
sudo umount /mnt

Reboot the system:

sudo reboot



6. Check for Firmware Updates:

Make sure your UEFI firmware is up-to-date. You can check the manufacturer's website for updates.




These steps should help resolve the SBAT-related Secure Boot issue while keeping Secure Boot enabled. If the problem persists, you may need to look into specific Secure Boot and SBAT compatibility settings or patches for your distribution.
